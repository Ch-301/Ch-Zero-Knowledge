## `0xArsi` Tips
I would also build motivation to learn such things by picking a protocol (say, plonk proving system), attempting to read about it and understand what it does. If you don’t, and you see words like “elliptic curve group” and “pairing” and “KZG commitment” and “Schwarz zippel lemma” go look at those things individually / understand them, then read about the plonk proving system again.
Repeat this and every time it’s like watching a movie and noticing things you missed/understanding the story better.
